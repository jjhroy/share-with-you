## 你好，这是我的第一篇博客

> Hi, I’m Roy. After a year, I’ve finally decided to start my new blog project. Over the past year, I changed workplaces, and now there are only two web developers, so I’ve had to take on more responsibilities than before. It’s also my first time leading a new project, which has been a real challenge for me. After a few months, I successfully completed the project, and it has been an incredible learning experience. That’s why I’m excited to create this blog—to meet new people and share my ideas with them.
